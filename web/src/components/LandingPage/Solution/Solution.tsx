              The solution is Wordification™ – a gamified interactive
              spelling-instruction platform based on linguistic principles which
              is dialectally responsive and incorporates AI-based internal
              assessment. With relevant linguistic principles embedded within
              the application, Wordification™ provides accurate, evidence-based
              instruction, even when teachers lack explicit knowledge of the
              linguistic system. The application’s database includes relevant
              phonological, orthographic, morphological, and semantic properties
              of individual words (and groups of words), and the application’s
              code uniquely incorporates, hidden to the user, theoretical
              approaches to spelling acquisition and data-based spelling
              instructional strategies. Words and word features all have
              associated audio files, including{' '}
              <b>dialect-based pronunciations</b> and{' '}
              <b>careful-casual pronunciation contrasts</b>, enabling students
              to learn through both speech-to-text and text-to-speech exercises.
              Furthermore, Wordification™ implements individualized spelling
              instruction through internal assessment algorithms that determine
              a student’s appropriate instructional level and particular
              spelling needs. Fully developed, it will be an incredible
              breakthrough for all students, providing cost-effective
              individualized spelling instruction and making improved spelling
              instruction and higher literacy universally accessible and widely
              available. <br /> <br />
              <b>
                <em>Long Term.</em>
              </b>{' '}
              With Wordification™ fully gamified and equipped with the AI needed
              to guide students’ progress individually and independently of
              classroom instruction, it can then be turned into a
              word-processing software extension. Thus, once Wordification™ is
              equipped to monitor a student-user’s progress and guide them
              through a spelling syllabus, it should also be able to respond to
              that student’s errors while typing. Accordingly, if <i>MS Word</i>{' '}
              is tracking a student’s errors through Spell Check, it (or any
              other spell-checking tool) could be enabled to port the student’s
              errors to Wordification™ so that the student would be offered
              spelling practice on precisely those words they misspelled on
              their next session in the Wordification™ game. At this point,
              spelling would no longer need be taught in the classroom and
              students (
              <b>regardless of their dialect or native-speaker status</b>) would
              be guided into English spelling in a manner that guarantees
              universal success.

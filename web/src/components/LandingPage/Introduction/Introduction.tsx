            The Wordification® Project is developing a web-based game system
            aimed at providing a language-based (as opposed to memory based)
            tool for English spelling instruction, and one that does not rely on
            teacher training. The application will be engineered so as to
            provide individuated instruction that can accommodate a full
            spectrum of learners.{' '}
            <b>
              It will also offer dialectally enhanced instruction for speakers
              of non-mainstream English dialects and careful-casual
              pronunciation contrasts for non-native English speakers.
            </b>{' '}
            As a resource that can deliver as much or as little spelling
            instruction as any given student may need, it will provide students
            who have decoding deficits (e.g., dyslexia) a path to enhanced
            literacy that would otherwise be missing from their education. The
            goal of this project is to provide a universally accessible,
            low-cost intervention nation-wide, and thereby to have a substantial
            positive impact on literacy (and hence national economic welfare) in
            every educational jurisdiction in which it is utilized.

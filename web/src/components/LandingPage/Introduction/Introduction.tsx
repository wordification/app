            Can dialectally responsive, linguistically based spelling
            instruction provided through computer-based gamified instruction
            support students’ spelling development across a variety of dialects,
            to make literacy widely and universally available?
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, classroom spelling instruction is largely
            memorization-based and one-size-fits-all. More sophisticated,
            individualized tutoring methods are available only to those wealthy
            enough to afford it.
            <br />
            To make improved spelling instruction universally accessible and
            promote higher literacy, our team has worked to design a new method
            of spelling instruction that is both beneficial to typical students
            and a breakthrough for literacy-challenged students.
            <br />
            Wordification is a gamified interactive spelling-instruction
            platform based on linguistic principles, incorporating AI-based
            internal assessment. Fully developed, it will provide
            cost-effective, individualized spelling instruction for all
            students.
